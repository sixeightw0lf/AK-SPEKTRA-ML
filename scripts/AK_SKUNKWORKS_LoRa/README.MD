AK-SKUNKWORKS LoRa Fine-Tuning
================================

Welcome to the **AK-SKUNKWORKS LoRa Fine-Tuning** project! This Python script allows you to fine-tune and create LoRa adapter models with Transformers PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning). It combines the cutting-edge technology of Arkane Industries and Lockheed Martin Skunk Works, enabling you to create highly efficient and powerful language models.

Features
--------

*   Fine-tune large-scale language models using the PEFT method
*   Create LoRa adapter models with Transformers
*   Efficiently train models with minimal parameter updates
*   Customize the training process with a user-friendly configuration file
*   Automatically preprocess and fix issues in the dataset
*   Save and push the trained models to Hugging Face Hub

Requirements
------------

*   Python 3.6 or higher
*   TensorFlow 2.3.0 or higher
*   Transformers 4.0.0 or higher
*   Datasets 1.0.0 or higher
*   Hugging Face Hub 0.0.6 or higher

Quickstart
----------

1.  Clone this repository:

    bash

    `git clone https://github.com/sixeightw0lf/AK-SKUNKWORKS_LoRa.git`

2.  Install the required packages:



    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3.  Modify the `config/ak_skunkworks_lora_config.json` file to set your preferred model, tokenizer, dataset, and training parameters.

4.  Run the `SKUNKWORKS_LoRa.py` script to start the fine-tuning process:

    `python SKUNKWORKS_LoRa.py`

5.  Upon completion, the trained model and tokenizer will be saved in the specified output directory.

6.  (Optional) Push the model to Hugging Face Hub by providing your Hugging Face API key in the `config.json` file.


Configuration
-------------

The `config/ak_skunkworks_lora_config.json` file contains various settings that you can modify to customize the fine-tuning process. Some of the key settings include:

*   `model`: The pre-trained model to fine-tune
*   `model_tokenizer`: The tokenizer corresponding to the pre-trained model
*   `data`: The training dataset file
*   `eval_data`: The evaluation dataset file
*   `MICRO_BATCH_SIZE`: The micro batch size for training
*   `GRADIENT_ACCUMULATION_STEPS`: The number of gradient accumulation steps
*   `EPOCHS`: The number of training epochs
*   `LEARNING_RATE`: The learning rate for the optimizer
*   `CUTOFF_LEN`: The maximum token length for input sequences

Please refer to the `config/ak_skunkworks_lora_config.json` file for a complete list of settings and their descriptions.
