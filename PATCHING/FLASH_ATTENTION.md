### Fix FlashAttention v0.2.8 Issue on NVIDIA A6000 (Ampere)

To fix the issue related to the FlashAttention v0.2.8 on the NVIDIA A6000 (Ampere) system, you will need to modify the `flash_attn_interface.py` file to support the sm86 architecture. Please follow the steps below to create a patch for the issue:

1.  **Create a backup of the original `flash_attn_interface.py` file:**

bash

`cp flash_attn/flash_attn_interface.py flash_attn/flash_attn_interface.py.backup`

2.  **Open the `flash_attn/flash_attn_interface.py` file in a text editor and locate the line where the error is raised (around line 42):**

python

`_, _, _, softmax_d = flash_attn_cuda.bwd(`

3.  **Before this line, insert a check for the sm86 architecture and update the error message:**

python

`if not (torch.cuda.get_device_capability() in [(8, 0), (8, 6)]):     raise RuntimeError("Expected GPU with sm80 or sm86 architecture, but got a different one.") _, _, _, softmax_d = flash_attn_cuda.bwd(`

4.  **Save the changes and close the text editor.**

5.  **Create a patch file with the changes:**


bash

`diff -u flash_attn/flash_attn_interface.py.backup flash_attn/flash_attn_interface.py > flash_attn_sm86_support.patch`

You have now created a patch called `flash_attn_sm86_support.patch` that fixes the issue related to the FlashAttention v0.2.8 on NVIDIA A6000 systems. To apply the patch, run the following command:

bash

`patch -p0 < flash_attn_sm86_support.patch`

This will update the `flash_attn_interface.py` file with the changes needed to support the sm86 architecture.
